## What does what

I hardly use any adjustments except those accessible via the first Bank,
so that is why only it is listed. Most other banks were left to whatever
they were set to by the original configuration I started from.

| Defringe Purple | Dehaze | Vibrance | Saturation |
| Blacks   | Shadows    | Highlights  | Whites     |
| Exposure | Straighten | Temperature | Tint       |

### Lateral Buttons
